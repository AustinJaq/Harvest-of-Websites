        <h1>Jaden Sisneros</h1>
        <p>Im jaden (aka MrSoggE) and i'm one of the multipurpose tools the gods have chosen to torture for the use of making a video game! I hate my life, and love coding.</p>
        <p>This is not my first project, and when being presented with game ideas, this project I could see the most vividly in my head, and I really wanted to play this game. So I'll be working to make it the most dream-like nightmare you've ever played! I worked on a lot of separate things for this project, like the music, models, coding, ui, marketing, and anything else I could get my grubby hands on.</p>
