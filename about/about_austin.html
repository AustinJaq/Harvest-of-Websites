        <h1>Austin Jaquier</h1>
        <p>Hello I'm Austin, I enjoy animals, technology, and magic. I love to create things in my spare time, my favorite colors are yellow, pink, purple, and brown in that order.</p>
        <p>The reason I joined was because I thought that this genre of game would be fun to work with. I have dabbled in numerous games before but none of them have ever been completed, this game will be my first published game, and while I am probably underqualified I'm excited to see how it'll turn out.</p>
