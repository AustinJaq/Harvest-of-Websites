        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Harvest of Shadows is a first-person free-roam survival horror farming stealth game where you look over a farm of deranged, mutilated, disturbing farm animals who need food, and if you don't give them food, they go after you. So you have to feed them these "Straw dolls". You acquire these by stealing them from the town, and they are unwilling to give them to you. They seem willing to end it all just to keep their precious "Straw dolls" safe, so there is some stealth involved and some potential for combat if you are caught, so it's important to be sneaky. Once you have acquired the stuffed animal, throw them in a sack, tie the end, and drive back. Once you're back on the farm, different animals like different parts of these stuffies, so if you want to be more effective, you should put it on an altar and chop off its limbs to be able to feed to different animals. To keep the player from just maintaining a few animals, you have voices in your head who slowly get hungrier and have an urge for more, so you have to add more to the farm, which gives you a reward of some kind but makes it so you have more to take care of.</p>
